Step 3: Offset

         a) Constant offset:- Enter the value in the textfield and click "Submit". Goto Step 4.
       
                                 OR

         b) Variable offset:- Enter the values in the given table and press enter on your
                        
                             keyboard and finally press the "Submit" button. Goto Step 4.                  
  

Step 4: Halfstrike

         a) Constant Halfstrike:- Enter the value in the textfield and click "Submit". Goto Step 5.

                                 OR

         b) Variable Halfstrike:- Enter the values in the given table and press enter on your
                        
                             keyboard and finally press the "Submit" button. Goto Step 5.


Step 5: Surface density & Lambda :-Enter the value in the textfields and click "Submit". Goto Step 6.

Step 6: Regional
       
         a) Constant regional:- Enter the value in the textfield and click "Submit". Goto Step 8. 
                                        
                                             OR
         
         b) Variable regional:- Enter the degree of the polynomial and click "Submit". Bouguer gravity anomaly will appear on the screen.
                                
                                With the help of mouse clicks select control points in the anomaly panel to decipher appropriate regional trend. 

				In case regional field has to be modified/edited goto step 7 else goto step 8. 
                                
                                Note:- The number of control points should exceed the selected degree of polynomial.


Step 7: Draw/Edit polynomial:- Here user can edit the "Assumed/Estimated regional" with drag & drop mouse operations. Goto Step 8.


Step 8: Analysis:- Both "Modeling" and "Inversion" techniques are available. User can select any of them.


Step 9: Save & Print:- This option (under interpretation) helps the user to save the interpreted results in a html file. This file conatins the results

                       in both graphical and ASCII formS.        

Note: The number of gravity anomalies, station elevations, off strikes and offsets must be equal to the number of observations.
